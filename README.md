# Learning TypeScript by Test-Driven Development

I'm learning TypeScript on [Exercism](https://exercism.org). This repository contains my solutions to the exercises I've done, or at least the most recent iterations of them; if you want to see my earlier iterations, those will all be published over on [my Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/crabbit-git/solutions).

If you're learning TypeScript yourself, especially if you're doing that on Exercism, please don't use this to cheat. Santa's watching. Besides, I'm just learning this myself, so I highly doubt that my solutions will all be optimal anyway.
